This is for small sample images to be used with qemu-iotests, intended for
non-native formats that QEMU supports for compatibility.  The idea is to use
the native tool to create the sample image.

For instance, a VHDX image in this directory would be an image created not by
QEMU itself, but rather created by Hyper-V.

Sample images added here must be compressed with bzip2.

linux-buildroot-* are self-contained Linux kernel+initrd images, used for
tests that need a live guest. They are built using buildroot, currently at
https://github.com/skyportsystems/buildroot-1/commits/qemu-iotests . To
build linux-buildroot-x86_64.bzImage:

- make qemu-iotests_x86_64_defconfig
- make
- cp output/images/bzImage /x/qemu/tests/qemu-iotests/sample_images/linux-buildroot-x86_64.bzImage

To boot the guest and run some shell commands, a test can pass
  -kernel linux-buildroot-x86_64.bzImage
  -append 'console=ttyS0 rdinit=/bin/sh -c "mount -t devtmpfs devtmpfs /dev; echo hi; cat"'
to qemu.
